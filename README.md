# noveler
Noveler is a framework for building a novel, short-story, or serial-writing app. It can be used-as is in scripts or in a
REPL, or it can be used as a back-end in a GUI app. Noveler uses a simple, plain-text format for writing and storing 
stories. It's designed to be easy to use and easy to extend. The app has a set of Assistants that help with writing,
editing, and managing stories. These Assistants are designed around the ollama ecosystem, allowing the user to use the 
GGUF models of their choice, and different models for different kinds of tasks. Mom, that means there is a free, open 
source program you can install on Windows, Linux, or Mac that allows you to interact with a variety of artificial 
intelligence models (like ChatGPT or GPT 4, but scaled down to run on your desktop PC) to help you write your stories.

###Update 
Work has begun on the GUI app, which will be built using PyQt6.

### How to install
Clone the repo and open it in a modern Python IDE, like PyCharm. PyCharm Community Edition is free. 

### How to use
Well, it's a framework without a front end, so the project becomes the basis of your own app. Consider this a skeleton 
application. You can use the `noveler` module in your own scripts, or you can use the `noveler` module in a GUI app.

## Getting started
Open main.py and begin using the framework. More helpful instructions will be added as the project develops.
