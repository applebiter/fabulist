# noveler
Noveler is a simple novel writing tool that allows you to write and organize your novel in a clean and simple interface. 
It is designed to be easy to use and to help you focus on writing your novel. It is written in Python and will use the 
Pyside6 library for the GUI. At this time, the app is in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for use. 
There will be integration with the ollama ecosystem, and the use of RAG and agent-based models to help the writer. I, 
for one, welcome our new language model _partners_, but I also want to do it on my own hardware, working just fine even 
in offline mode. 100% free, 100% open source, 100% private. The user can use which ever models they want, and the app 
will be able to use them, if the embeddings are compatible.
