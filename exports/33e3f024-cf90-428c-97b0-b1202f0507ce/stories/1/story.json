                    "content": "Ralph didn't enjoy getting dirty on accident and certainly not on purpose; but here he lies in the shadows of The Stinky Possum Pub covered in dead leaves and old grass clippings. Waiting.\n\n\nTwo days ago Flando the rat, Frances\u2019 brother, came to him concerned for the alley cats that had disappeared and then returned later with terrible stories.\n\n\n\n\u201cFamily and friends reported they weren\u2019t the same when they came back home. The cats don\u2019t have an interest in the things they used to enjoy. Half the time they show no emotion, the other half they are angry and lash out at anyone who tries to help. Still, others never came back,' said Flando.\n\n\nRalph listened then said, \u201cThe ferals have taken a hard hit from illness this year. I\u2019ve never seen it this widespread. And now this, this news truly troubling. How long has this been happening?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d say about a month. It started after the big fall clean up the city does each year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow many food stations would you guess have been removed?\u201d asked Ralph.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the ones in the front of the Peed Street shops and in the city square. Raccoons now control the ones in the alleys and you know what trouble that can bring. Their leader, Jeff, rules with an iron paw. Cats must go further into the house areas to find food but the people are afraid their own cats  will get sick.\u201d\n\n\n\nReplaying the conversation in his head over and over he tried to tease out more clues, Ralph had dozed off when someone triggered one of his crispy leaf alarms. With half-slit eyes, he watched as cat after cat entered a small alcove. After the eighth cat entered, he followed them where they sat  in a circle with their backs towards each other. Before he joined them a loud clang rang out as a gate crashed down behind him. Cats scattered to the shadows. Then another gate came down in front of him. They trapped him before he could run. He couldn\u2019t see much through the metal grate, a tail here, an ear there. A pink nose owned by a cat with terrible breath, worse than mashed peas and garlic, blocked his view.\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take kindly to strangers poking about,\u201d said a raspy voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cI bet he\u2019s the one getting everybody snatched,\u201d said another.\n\n\n\n\u201cOr sick. I\u2019ve seen his kind. Thinks he can slip in and weed out the weak ones, clean up the riffraff.\u201d said a third.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said the cats.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat shall we do with him?\u201d said the first.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet him!\u201d meowed a chorus cats with a few hisses.\n\nAgent Ralph did not understand what that meant but it couldn\u2019t be good. These traumatized cats were out for blood. He hadn\u2019t noticed the rat before but caught his shadow out of the corner of his eye. It sat up on whatever it perched on and addressed the group. The rat had a can lid in his hand which he banged with a spoon to bring the meeting to order. The cats didn\u2019t pay attention and now they marched towards Ralph. As soon as he saw them back up towards him he pressed his large Maine Coon body up against the back gate and closed his eyes preparing for what was to come.\n\n\n\nThe host said, \u201cGood evening, everyone. My name is Flando and I\u2019m glad you made it to this meeting. If this is your first time you don\u2019t have to take part but I encourage you to get it off your chest.\u201d The male cats took turns peeing on the closed gate. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Flando.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve caught a snooper!\u201d yelled a cat.\n\n\n\n\u201cOoh, he\u2019s a big one, too,\u201d said another.\n\n\n\n\u201cStop, stop, stop!\u201d shouted Flando as he banged on the lid again. The cats backed away. A tiny brown nose with long whiskers appeared in front of Ralph. \u201cAre you all right, sir?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cFresh air would be nice.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlando worked the latch and opened the gate. Ralph had no idea Frances\u2019 brother was such a felinitarian. He\u2019d have to congratulate him later for doing such a fine job and a much-needed service. These cats were a rough bunch and Ralph did not blame them for their anger.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d Flando said pinching his nose. Ralph stepped through the gate and sat next to Flando. \u201cAllow me to introduce a special guest, Agent Ralph who is an important member of our community and as a Domesticated Investigation Bureau officer is investigating what is happening. Now, before you get upset I want you to know I invited him here. I asked him to join our group and listen to what has happened to you so he can solve this mystery. I understand that you may not wish to share but remember why he is here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much for the wonderful introduction, Flando. It is true. I am investigating these occurrences and will do everything in my power to sort this out. I know you are upset and that these things that have happened are frightening. What I hear in this alcove, I promise you, won\u2019t leave the alcove,\u201d Ralph said. \u201cIt would be most helpful if you could tell me what happened to you.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilence. No one came forward.\n\n\n\nFlando stood on his hind legs, \u201cCome on now, are you so angry you can\u2019t help those who are still missing? Ralph is our best chance of finding out who is doing this.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt last, an orange tabby stepped forward. \u201cThank you, Nacho,\u201d said Flando.\n\n\n\n\u201cI remember little of what led up to it. I saw a bright light getting closer and closer,\u201d said Nacho.\n\n\n\nThen they took turns telling Ralph of their experience.\n\n\n\n\u201cMudd here. I have dreams of monsters. They wore space suits and had big round eyes. I thought I was gone for an hour or two,\u201d said a tortoiseshell, \u201cwhen I came back my brother Ollie was gone and is still missing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe female calico next to him said, \u201cMy friends call me Zitzit cause I like to catch bugs that make that noise. Well, I used to. Now all the bugs remind me of the monsters. There were a bunch of us there together in the holding area. I was so scared I peed myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nMudd reached over and licked Zitzit\u2019s face to soothe her.\n\n\n\n\u201cHi, my name is Checkers. I remember lights also. I was examined by the monsters in those suits,\u201d he looked down at the ground, \u201csorry for peeing on you.\u201d said one of the two black and white cats.\n\n\n\nThe other said, \u201cYeah, sorry about that. I\u2019m Chappy. It felt like a short time, but we had been missing three days. Now I have a lump on my shoulder.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMe too. Everyone calls me Midnight.\u201d said a female black cat.\n\n\n\nThe orange and white cat next to Midnight said, \u201cMy name is Butterbean. When I came back, I saw my brother Nacho, who had been missing two days before they took me. They cut his ear, and he had a small scar on his stomach.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen Butterbean came back her ear was also cut, and she had a much bigger scar. We noticed that we all have our left ears cut and a fresh scar on our lower stomach,\u201d said Nacho.\n\n\n\nLast was a white cat, \u201cWe all have a green mark. I try to lick it off but it never goes away. All the other cats and animals here are afraid of us now. Oh, I\u2019m Snowball.\u201d\n\n\n\nCheckers said, \u201cWe all have the mark. We\u2019re a bunch of misfits. I suppose that is why we were being mean. Those monsters hurt us and then our loved ones rejected us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for your time and patience. I know this has been very difficult,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cbut I must take my leave to investigate further. I bid you a good evening. Please, ask any member of the 121st Street Clowder for help or if you\u2019d like to offer further information. We\u2019d be happy to help you in any way we can.\u201d\n\n\n\nRalph bowed then left. He believed they had experienced a horrible thing. Alien abduction. Their injuries followed a pattern, many of them still fresh. Ralph had to get abducted himself to know for sure.\n\n\n\nA voice from the shadows stopped him in his tracks. 'Well, well, well. If it isn't a big, bad DIBs agent.' Ralph turned just in time to see a group of raccoons attacks him placing a pillow case over his head and dragging him through the grass.\n    ",

                    "content": "Meanwhile, Milton, Archie, and Frances were listening to the evening DIBs report, when a plaintive meowing broke their concentration. Archie was getting irritated but it didn\u2019t take much to annoy him. \u201cMilton, are you going to get that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Milton asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cNever mind, I'll do it myself,' Archie said heading out the cat door.\n\n\n\u201cGo ahead, Milton. I\u2019ll catch you two up later.\u201d Frances said waving off Milton.\n\n\n\nMilton found Archie sitting in the driveway. \u201cWas that just my imagination?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWould I be out here if it were your imagination?\u201d Archie, the old Russian Blue, asked.\n\n\n\n'No,' Milton said.\n\n\n\u201cPlease, come out. I won\u2019t sit in the dark all night.\u201d Archie said.\n\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I don\u2019t want to be a bother,\u201d said a quiet voice coming from the privet.\n\n\n\n\u201cToo late. Now, my dear how can I help you?\u201d Archie asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a DIBs agent, aren\u2019t you? You can help me?\u201d said a female black and white tuxedo cat.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, I am an agent. I may help you but first, you need to tell me who you are and what is your matter.'\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Tiff and my partner Ollie has gone missing,' she said.\n\n\n\u201cWhen and where did you last see him?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was two nights ago, and he headed towards the alley behind the shops on Peed Street.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCan you tell us any more about what happened before he disappeared?' Milton asked. Frances came out and sat beside him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been having trouble sleeping. He said he knew where he could get something to help. Ollie told me not to worry that Jeff could help.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWho is Jeff?\u201d asked Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cJeff is a dumpster dealer her gang runs the alley behind The Stinky Possum Pub. Ollie doesn\u2019t keep that sort of company and I\u2019m afraid for him. I didn\u2019t want him going there and end up getting sick. Things are so bad in the alleys. If cats aren\u2019t getting sick, they\u2019re disappearing. Only the kittens seem to be safe from kidnapping but many don\u2019t get over the illness.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Archie.\n\n\n\nFrances went inside to fetch a few items and came back with cat food and two collars.\n\n\u201cOoh! Who are those for?\u201d asked Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou two,' said Frances fastening them around Milton and Archie. Since she became a consultant for DIBs she was making many advances in her technical creations. 'I've made upgrades. They now have a tracking device which monitors your location here and a proximity detector so you can find your way to each other. Located here is a small speaker. I didn't have time to add a switch to give you a microphone so you'll only be able to receive messages in Morris code.'\n\n\n\u201cWhy is it making that noise?\u201d asked Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is Ralph's signal. If you are within sniffing range there is no signal. If you change your direction the pitch will change. The collar will beep higher if you are heading towards each other and lower if you are going away. As you get closer the beeps get faster. I fit a motion detector on them but will only register clockwise and counter-clockwise movement. It is designed for answering questions with a yes or no reply in either direction. If you scratch the collar twice that means yes and three scratches means no. If you keep scratching you ask for backup. Everything clear?' Frances asked.\n\n\nArchie\u2019s face beamed with pride, \u201cOutstanding work, Frances.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou guys are a high-tech operation aren't you?' asked Tiff.\n\n\n\u201cYou two go ahead, if anything comes up, I\u2019ll contact you on your collar. Remember two scratches for yes and three for no.\u201d Frances said. She\u2019d ruin her street credibility if her contacts saw her in that alley with DIBs agents and she hated the stench of Peed Street.\n\n\n\nWith their new collars on Milton and Archie headed toward the back yard.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very polite for a street cat, how long have you been feral?\u201d asked Frances.\n\n\n\n\u201cThree years,\u201d said Tiff. \u201cIt seem like only yesterday I had a warm lap to sit on, plenty of food, water, and sunshine patches to sleep in. Then my owners lost their house, and I was abandoned. If it hadn\u2019t met Ollie, I might have starved.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrances sighed, \u201cI understand, if I hadn\u2019t met these cats, I don\u2019t know what I would do. I\u2019m sure good will come out of this. DIBs agents are good cats. I thought you might be hungry, I brought you some food and there\u2019s fresh water in that bowl over there.\u201d she pointed with a little pink paw to a bowl near the steps leading into the kitchen.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much for your kindness, Frances,\u201d said Tiff. Frances acknowledged Tiff with a nod and thought of her brother who she always thought he was silly for the work he did helping stray animals. But now, she understood his wish to be a part of something bigger than just surviving.\n\n\n\nFrances watched Tiff eat and leave. Turning on the transmeowter she let Archie, Milton, and Ralph know there was a new agent in the vicinity.\n    ",

                    "content": "Archie and Milton headed down the alley behind the house, cross over to the haunted house then take Peed Street to Ralph's location. They were almost at the haunted house when they saw a dark cat slink off towards Peed Street.\n\n\nThey backed into the bushes when their collars buzzed with Morris code. The mystery cat looked in their direction but kept going. That was a close. Archie would have to talk to Frances about changing the volume.\n\n\n\n        \u201cNew agent in territory.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat was close,\u201d said Milton, \u201cYou think is the new agent?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d said Archie as he followed the silky brown cat. Milton ran a few paces to catch up to Archie. They\u2019d only traveled a block before the new cat realized it was being tailed. It took another block for Archie and Milton to lose the cat. They dropped their gaze low to listen for any movement.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid that cat just disappear?\u201d asked Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot likely,\u201d said Archie. \u201cWe have a job to do and should get on it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd stay out of my way,\u201d said a deep female voice that was almost a growl.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou must be the new agent,\u201d said Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cA real charmer,\u201d said Archie, \u201cI\u2019d probably hide too if I was that grumpy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt takes lint to pick up lint.\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nMilton blinked and tilted his head at the phrase trying to decipher it. This agent must have had very different training in codes.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have important work to do,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSure kid, don\u2019t we all,\u201d said Archie.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut, Archie,\u201d said Milton, \u201cyou don\u2019t hide.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not helping, Milton.\u201d said Archie.\n\n\n\nMilton was still trying to figure out what she said. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s grumpy because she has a hairball from the lint, Archie.\u201d\n\n\n\n'I don't have a hairball, and that is not what I meant,' she said. 'Seriously, cat's lives are at stake here.'\n\n\nArchie\u2019s and Milton\u2019s collar chirped a series of three chirps and then a long drawn out chirp that sounded like a cricket. This differed from what Frances sent them previously. Ralph was sending a message via scratch cipher.\n\n\n\nThe dark brown cat tilted her head, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019re the only DIBs agent here?\u201d he asked her, \u201cCome on Milton, she is a distraction. We have to find Ollie,\u201d said Archie.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty distraction,\u201d Milton said.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a Burmese; a brick wrapped in silk, Milt,\u201d said Archie as he trotted off down Peed Street.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like my notebook then don\u2019t flip my pages.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgain, Milton tilted his head trying to work out her puzzling language. \u201cI never got your name,\u201d said Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cI never gave it,\u201d said the chocolate brown cat.\n\n\n\nMilton shook his head then ran off to catch up to Archie. His ears focused behind him as he heard her say, \u201cMinka! My name is Minka.\u201d The Flame-point Siamese gave a twitch of his tail to signal that he heard her and slipped into the darkness.\n\n\n\nMinka trotted at an easy pace behind them and wondered what business they could have in the exact area where all of the sicknesses originated. The hair on the back of her ears prickled. Someone was watching her from above in the trees. She\u2019d have to investigate later. Minka straightened her legs to pick up the pace, then she too disappeared into the shadows.\n    ",

                    "content": "This was not what he had in mind.  \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. Release me!\u201d Ralph said trying to fight his way out of the bag. His collar buzzed with a message from Frances about a new agent. The rest of the team were listening to the evening DIBs report.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d One raccoon said.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet the door would ya?\u201d another voice said.\n\n\n\nThere was a terrible scraping noise of a metal door opening and then closing behind him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWelcome, Agent Ralph,\u201d said a relaxed female voice.\n\n\n\nRalph untangled himself from the pillow case. The bag had been dark his eyes adjusted to the low light in the shed. In front of him, he saw a raccoon swishing her paws in a pail of water. A small crate separated them. Pulling her paws out of the water, she had a small piece of metal in each one.  She placed an item on one plate, and the other item on another plate. While raccoons have an excellent sense of smell, the sensitivity of their hands increases five-fold when wet. 'Fifteen for this one and 8 for that one,' she told an old raccoon wearing an eye patch that came forward to take the plates. She sold kibble she had stolen from the neighborhood.\n\n\nTwo raccoons guarded the door behind Ralph preventing his escape. The beep of his collar changed pitch signaling that Archie and Milton headed in his direction. Ralph had to warn them. He pretended to have fleas. First, he scratched a series of no replies. Then he bit his legs and scratched behind his ears. He scratched the collar requesting backup. He hoped it worked.\n\n\n\u201cTsk, tsk, tsk. You have been snooping around in places you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Jeff. \u201cYou picked up fleas and who knows what else. This has been a bad year for cats.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, Jeff, why don't you tell me about your collaboration with them,' Ralph said looking up towards the sky.\n\n\nJeff looked up then back at Ralph. \u201cApparently the fever has already claimed you. Lucky, raccoons are immune.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe two guards behind Ralph chuckled.\n\n\n\n'You know what I'm talking about. The disappearances. Tell me what you know and I'll make sure the authorities are lenient. I\u2019ve got good information you\u2019re helping the aliens abduct them.\u201d  Ralph sneered.\n\n\n\u201cAliens\u2026 authorities?!\u201d Jeff blurted out no longer able to contain her laughter. \u201cI\u2019m only offering what your aliens have left behind for them, without trapping them. See for yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe old, one-eyed raccoon brought out a pellet and placed it on the crate that stood between Ralph and Jeff.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook closer,\u201d said Jeff stepping back.\n\n\n\nRalph took a step closer and sniffed the pellet. It was chicken and catnip scented. There was something else there that he couldn\u2019t place his paw on, something familiar. Satisfied, Ralph asked, \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know,\u201d said one guard as both of them stepped closer.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, now. If I told you that would be bad for business. Ah! There is a way you can find out,\u201d said Jeff waving a paw in the air in revelation.\n\n\n\nRalph didn\u2019t trust this raccoon. He trusted none of them, but especially not Jeff. \u201cAnd how is that?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\nJeff brought her paws down and placed them on the make-shift table, leaning forward. With a grimace on her face exposing her sharp teeth she growled, \u201cEat it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe proximity detector on Ralph\u2019s collar beeped faster and faster.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe sounds like he\u2019s got a bomb,\u201d said the guard.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a bomb. Shut up and do your job!\u201d snarled Jeff hurling a trinket at the creature.\n\n\n\nThe guards pressed up against Ralph showing their long, sharpened claws.\n\n\n\n\u201cEat it!\u201d Jeff pounded her fists on the table making the pellet bounce.\n\n\n\nThey hemmed in Ralph. He didn\u2019t want to endanger Archie and Milton so he ate the pellet. He realized the mystery ingredient was a sedative. It would take more than one pellet to knock out a cat of his size but it would still hinder his thinking. He wouldn\u2019t be able to protect his partners from these bandits.\n\n\n\nJeff was furious. Her teeth bared and waving her paws around, \u201cThose vile creatures in their space suits come here every morning before sunrise with their beams of light shining everywhere. This place is lit up like daytime. They take the traps with the cats and raccoons. Oh yes, I bet you didn\u2019t count on that one. But raccoons don\u2019t come back like your cats do. I\u2019m willing to bet those monsters will come for you too. The fewer cats the better, then the rest of us can get back to living our lives!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe noise of the collar increased in speed until it was just a single tone. He laid his ears back in response to the noise, it was really loud. And then it stopped. Ralph knew Milton and Archie were close by.\n\n\n\nA bell rang out. \u201cYour aliens have arrived. Come on fellas, let\u2019s beat feet!\u201d said Jeff.\n\n\n\nRalph watched them escape through a small hole. He knew raccoons could collapse their spines but had never seen it.\n    ",

                    "content": "After sending the last message, Frances puzzled over how to listen to what was happening with the agents. The radio signal would only reach so far. On the transmeowter were lights, buttons, a small screen, and switches. A different light for each collar showed her if the agents were on the move. Frances could see how far away they were from 121st Street Clowder Headquarters on a digital map. Headquarters was anywhere on either Millie\u2019s or Maggie\u2019s property. They were such good friends they removed the fence between their yards.\n\n\nFrances, in the middle of experimenting with the transmeowter, thought she broke something as a series of chirps came from the little speaker. A series of 3 scratches and a very long chirp. The signal was coming from Ralph\u2019s collar. Right now she could only send Morris code and receive scratch cipher. She needed to hear what was going on in the field. If she rerouted the send from the Morris code button to the microphone on the transmeowter she could reverse the polarity turning it into a speaker. But would it work? She had installed two-way devices on all of their collars but would have to signal the chip to listen instead of play. There was only one way to do that, bite-nary.\n\n\n\nFrances was just learning bite-nary. Grabbing a length of wire to suit her needs, she chewed some of the wrappings off exposing the metal. She attached one end to the send button. Pulling out her notes from communication class, Frances thought she'd better write out the signal so she would have a better chance of getting it right. If she didn't get it right, Jeff and her gang could hurt Ralph and the others. Electrocuting herself was also a possibility.\n\n\nThe dumbo eared, brown and white rat grabbed the coated wire on each side of the bare metal, grounded her body, looked at her message and touched her tongue on the wire to interrupt the electricity. She had to send out a greeting message so the chip would be alert. Her ankles buzzed as the weak current flowed through her body. Next was the instructions to flip the poles so that the speakers would become microphones. She finished when she sneezed biting her tongue and breaking the wire. The electrical shock knocked her off her paws. What if it hadn\u2019t worked?  Squeezing her eyes shut hard to stop the room spinning and to get rid of the stars that filled her sight. Her hearing became fuzzy with a crackling sound interrupted by whooshing.  Her head filled with static and popping noises followed by silence. This is terrible, she couldn\u2019t go deaf. She thought about poor Ralph and the others mangled by who knows what or fallen down a storm drain or any other terrifying thing that could happen. Frances imagined Jeff arguing and her gang attacking the agents. Trying to get up again she knocked over her stool at the same time she heard voices. Great. Frances thought she\u2019d caused serious brain damage. But one of them sounded like Ralph.\n\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m only offering what your aliens have left behind for them, without trapping them. See  for yourself.\u201d said a female voice\n\n\n\n \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d said Ralph\n\n\n\nThe voices were interrupted by static, whistling and popping noises coming from the transmeowter\u2019s speakers.\n\n\n\n \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a bomb. Shut up and do your job!\u201d said the female voice\n\n\n\n \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty distraction,\u201d said Milton\n\n\n\n \u201cShe\u2019s a Burmese; a brick wrapped in silk, Milt,\u201d said Archie.\n\n\n\n \u201cEat it!\u201d shouted the female voice\n\n\n\nEverything was a jumble. It dawned on Frances what she heard was coming from the agents\u2019 collars. It worked and she wasn\u2019t deaf! Frances jumped to her feet to look at the map. \u201cNo wonder it was confusing,\u201d she said. Ralph  wasn\u2019t with Archie and Milton, but they were moving towards him. Soon, they\u2019d be in trouble too. She scurried out of her laboratory to tell Millie.\n    ",

                    "content": "\u201cHer name is Minka,\u201d said Milton as he caught up to Archie. He sat at the corner waiting to cross the street.\n\n\n\n\u201cHer name oughta be trouble. Did you understand what she was saying?\u201d asked Archie.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was strange, but it\u2019s cute. She is different from any other cat I\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\n\n\nArchie sighed and they both crossed the street. They didn\u2019t speak the rest of the way. Their collars beeped faster as they approached the alley behind the Stinky Possum Pub where Tiff said Ollie was last seen. Ralph was nearby.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must be near Ralph,\u201d said Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d said Archie.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see him anywhere. Do you think he\u2019s looking for Ollie, too?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps, Milton. He had a tip from Frances\u2019 brother. Ralph said he was going talk to some cats about disappearances of others in the area. Ollie was just one of many who has gone missing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so scary and sad,\u201d said Milton\n\n\n\nArchie\u2019s put his nose to the ground. He picked up Ralph\u2019s scent and followed it to a storage shed behind the pub. The shed stunk of raccoons. Milton and Archie could hear talking and leaned in closer.\n\n\n\n \u201cYour aliens have arrived. Come on fellas, let\u2019s beat feet!\u201d\n\n\n\nAlerted by scratching noises and footsteps, Milton and Archie saw four raccoons leave the shed.\n\n\n\n\u201cTake care of your partner,\u201d said a familiar female voice coming from the tall grass behind them. Minka continued, \u201cBackup is here, I\u2019ll catch up to you later.\u201d She climbed up the tree the raccoons used to escape and followed their trail. Raccoons could do serious damage to a lone cat, she had to be careful.\n\n\n\nMilton and Archie stood up and pushed the shed door open. Sitting there in the dark with a stupid grin on his face was Ralph.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhew!\u201d said Archie blinking back tears, \u201cYou are ripe.\u201d\n\n\n\n'Hey, guys!' slurred Ralph, happy to see them.\n\n\nThe shed was lit up with beams of light. They weren\u2019t fast enough to help Ralph escape.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening!\u201d said Ralph, \u201cI have to go with them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d asked Milton\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d said Archie looking over his partner whose fur was matted, he covered with leaves, grass, and stunk of cat urine.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d said Ralph, \u201cThey will take me and I will find the others.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Milton, \u201che\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat might work,\u201d said Archie, \u201cwe\u2019ll follow behind.\u201d\n\n\n\nArchie and Milton turned toward the tall grass behind the shed, \u201cOh, Ralph? Look for a fella named Ollie. His partner Tiff sent us to find him. Remember, his name is Ollie.\u201d\n\n\n\nRalph nodded his head, his body swayed and he sang. \u201cOlly, Olly, Oxen free!\u201d He couldn\u2019t remember where he heard it but it sounded funny.\n\n\n\nSilvery white beings with masks and goggles picked up Ralph. He was so relaxed they didn't even have to trap him but held him at arm's length and put him in a carrier of some sort.\n\n\nRalph looked out from the carrier unaware he was being carried. The effect of the drug was in full force. He felt like he was floating or flying. They loaded him up into the vehicle he shared with two other cats who were asleep.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis must be their ship!\u201d said Ralph, drooling a little as he settled down and fell asleep too.\n    ",

                    "content": "Ralph woke up in a cage. He tried to stand up but the room spun, so he leaned to look out instead. He was in a small room full of these cell-like cages. Some had cats in them, some rabbits and some were empty.\n\n\n\n\u201cOllie?\u201d he said, \u201cIs Ollie here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cQuiet down,\u201d said an older female voice, \u201cwe\u2019re tryin\u2019 to sleep in here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry, this is important,\u201d said Ralph.\n\n\n\nNo one heard Minka come into the holding area. Hoping to learn more about this agent and her case she sat down to listen below Ralph\u2019s cell.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo is sleep!\u201d said the same voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said a quiet voice coming from the cell next to Ralph, \u201cmy name is Oliver. But some cats call me Ollie. Well, just one cat. Who are you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Ralph and I am the lead investigator of the 121st Street Clowder of the Domesticated Investigation Bureau. Your partner Tiff came to us, told us you were missing. Are you all right?\u201d\n\n\n\nOllie wasn\u2019t sure he should trust this Ralph cat. \u201cOh, my sweet Tiff. I knew it wasn\u2019t a good thing to leave her there. I wanted her to rest,\u201d said Ollie, \u201cAs for me, I\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou'll be with her soon. My team has been working very hard on these disappearances. Would you mind answering a few questions?' asked Ralph.\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything better to do with our time,\u201d said Ollie.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou could sleep!\u201d said the female cat.\n\n\n\nRalph waited for things to quiet down. He then rolled over onto his side so he could be closer to Ollie\u2019s cell. Whispering he asked, \u201cCan you tell me what happened? What led up to you being caught?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, as much as I can remember. Tiff has been having such a hard time sleeping. All the sickness going around keeps her awake. She said she saw shadow monsters and then a few days later more cats would get sick. I thought she was imagining things. I couldn\u2019t watch her waste away and she was so afraid. So, I went to the alley behind The Stinky Possum Pub. There were rumors a dumpster dealer there that had something that would help Tiff sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJeff?\u201d asked Ollie\n\n\n\n\u201cYes. What a nasty creature. I couldn\u2019t afford her prices, I left and went searching on my own.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know where they got the pellets?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, yes. They were stealing from traps left out to capture us ferals. I don\u2019t know how they got them without being trapped themselves, but they did. I followed a team after I left Jeff\u2019s shed. They were almost done collecting them when the people arrived and scared them off. I took a chance and went for a pellet they\u2019d missed but I was trapped. That\u2019s the last thing I remember.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a doll?\u201d said a deep male voice. \u201cCome here and let me sniff you.\u201d\n\n\n\nRalph looked to find a dark cat sitting on the floor just below him. She was outside of the cells. She turned and swatted at the cell she sat in front of striking a big rabbit\u2019s cell door.\n\n\n\n\u201cUgh! Gross,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you spying on me?\u201d asked Ralph\n\n\n\nMinka jumped on a stool in the center of the room. \u201cI am on your side, Ralph. My name is Minka. As a DIBs agent, I have been investigating the spread of illness and disease among the cats, which has been faster than normal.'\n\n\nRalph asked, \u201cWhat do you think causes this?\u201d\n\n\n\n'Raccoons,' said Minka, 'they've been competing with cats for food and water. At first, they were upset that humans were taking more protective measures with their trash because it was attracting sick cats. But then they learned cats were dying and being removed from the area. So one raccoon decided it would be in the best interest of all the raccoons if they helped the cats get sick.'\n\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re immune,\u201d said Ralph his thinking becoming clearer.\n\n\n\nThen when the doctors trapped the cats to treat them and help them the raccoons became even bolder. The vets released the cats back into the alley after they healed. And that one raccoon made it her mission to stop cats being taken. So she stole pellets and infected them with what is making cats sick. She tells everyone what a hero she is for keeping cats from being abducted and they believe her.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet me guess, Jeff?\u201d asked Ralph.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, dear!\u201d said Ollie, \u201cI ate a pellet.\u201d\n\n\n\n'Yes, but you ate one from a trap so you're safe and they gave you a shot to prevent you from getting sick while you were here,' said Minka.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d asked Ollie\n\n\n\n\u201cMy handler is a doctor and works here,\u201d said Minka. \u201cThese abductions have been done to save the cats of Peed Street.\u201d\n\n\n\n'Save them? They are scarred for life physically and mentally. Their ability to have a family has been taken from them without their permission. You\u2019ve taken away any rights they have.' said Ralph.\n\n\n\u201cAnd they are alive. Spaying and neutering were the only ways I could get my handler to agree to help stop the spread of sickness,\u201d said Minka, \u201cthe raccoons are trying to kill us, Ralph.\u201d\n\n\n\nRalph was about to argue but the door swung open and a human entered along with Millie.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere you are, Ralph! Thank goodness Frances told me you were in trouble. I picked up Archie and Milton on the way here, and Minka.' said Millie who got a good look and whiff of Ralph. 'Wow! You're one stinky kitty. You must be groomed before you can come home. I'll call Maggie to pick up Archie and Milton, in the meantime, you will get a good bath.'\n\nRalph cringed at the thought but he would rather smell like a baby human now than how Peed Street got its name.\n    ",

He was glad to be home again and gave Frances a good head bonk, knocking her off her feet. She climbed onto his back and they headed to join Milton and Archie at Maggie\u2019s house.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Fancypants,\u201d said Archie, \u201clook at you!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought you were more of a brown tabby but now you look more silver. You smell like a baby\u2019s butt,\u201d said Milton.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood to see you two also,' said Ralph. 'Now, shall we have a meeting? Thanks to all our efforts, Ollie has been returned to Tiff safe and sound. I have referred him to Flando if he needs to talk to someone about what happened. Flando has been informed of the cause of the disappearances and has our full support in his efforts to help those who need it. In return, he is encouraging the cats to volunteer to be vaccinated and spayed or neutered.'\n\n\n\u201cMillie and Maggie have the details on that program and will speak to Minka\u2019s former handler about changing procedures to make the experience less traumatic.\u201d said Archie.\n\n\n\n\u201cFormer handler?\u201d asked Ralph.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,' said Minka who had joined them, 'I have my forever home with Archie and Milton which will take getting used to but I can handle it if I don't die from boredom first.'\n\n\n\u201cMaggie has placed her on temporary quarantine,\u201d said Milton, \u201ctwo weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d giggled Frances.\n\n\n\n\u201cMilton isn't so bad but Archie is staler than a used dryer sheet. I know how valuable they are to the team,' said Minka, 'they are very dedicated to the work. I admire that in a cat.'\n\n\nRalph was sure Archie stuck his tongue out at her. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019ve received orders that Minka is to be a part of the 121st Street Clowder. She has done amazing work that needs to continue. We can pick up the slack while she is in quarantine.\u201d\n\n\n\nMinka just nodded.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Milton, \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate another job well done.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey all made their way inside to catch the evening DIBs report.\n\n\n\u201cIt's time to catch the news,' said Ralph.\n    ",
